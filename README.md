Students should use this rubric: 
  https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797
for self-checking their submission.

To the Udacity Team
-------------------

In order to accomplish the enhancements I describe below I had to add a
variety of new images and make a few small modification to the game engine.
If you are testing the code please include the additional and changed files
in addition to app.js where the bulk of my code is. Thank you.



Rich's Notes
------------

“I hereby confirm that this submission is my work. I have cited above the origins of any parts of the submission that were taken from Websites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. By including this in my email, I understand that I will be expected to explain my work in a video call with a Udacity coach before I can receive my verified certificate.”

As a part of this project I mostly relied on the lessons and material provided 
by the Nanodegree course work. I also referenced W3Schools web page a few times
and the piazza and discussion forum for P3.

I was enjoying the creative aspect so much I caried it a little further than 
the rubric required. Here are some highlights for the game as I designed it.

- Informational and fun console log messages.
- Level progression
- Score tracking
- Multiple lives
- Game over and other player feedback
- Difficulty increase as levels progress
- Modification to Enemy object speeds as levels progress.
- Higher scoring as levels progress.
- New bug colors and attributes (and associated images)
- Bonus rewards (and associated image changes)
- Two debug modes for extended console logging

This has been a fun and rewarding project. I will likely keep working on this 
adding new features and working on tablet and window 8 compatibility, but for 
now it needs to be turned in for grading. My kids thank Udacity for this fun
beta testing opportunitiy they got to experience. We have a running challenge
for who can get the top score. As of writing this mine is 161.

Future enhancements
- Tracking top scores
- Windows 8 UI compatibility
- Touch screen compatibility
- Two player games
- New bug shapes
- bidirectional bugs
